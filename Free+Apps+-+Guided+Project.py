# # Free apps and their marketability
# 
# In this project, I am going to analyze types of mobile apps and how many users they attract. Therefore, we are going to compare different free apps with their visibility and popularity. We are going to compare the apps on both Android and iOS platforms.

# In the previous section we figured that there are duplicate entries for some apps. We also deleted any entry that was missing or was wrong.
# 
# Now we need to remove the redundant entries to stop us from double counting them. In order to do that, we will first create `dictionaries` to map app-names to their number of reviews. We will keep the app-names only when their value in the dictionary is the highest, i.e. we will count the app entries for the highest number of reviews as they are the latest data available. In the next few steps, we will perform this task.

#Once we have this dictionary, 
#we will create a data set with only unique rows

# Now we have removed any duplicate entries in our Google Play app data set.
# 
# The next step is to remove any apps that do not have **English** names. This is because we are catering to our English-speaking audiences. 
# 
# Using `ordinality` of the English alphabets, given by the **ASCII** codes, we will only keep alphabets that conform to this ordinality, i.e. in the range of `0 to 127`. 
# 
# Before we delete these rows in our data set, we first need to index and find out the app names with these characters which will be our next step.

# 1. Build a minimal Android version and launch on Google Play
# 2. Develop further if it gets a good response
# 3. If the app is profitable after 6 months, build an iOS version and launch it on Apple Store

# We need to assess profitable apps for both versions.

# ## Analyzing the frequency tables of different genres in iOS and Android apps
# 
# From the above analysis, we learn that in the Apple store data set, amongst the free English-named apps, **Games**, and **Entertainment** are the most common. Games dominate the iOS market by a huge margin. However, there is no such strong domination in the Android market. The Android market has **Family** and **Game** as the most common apps in our observable sub-sample. 
# 
# Based on this analysis, we can recommend Gaming apps (or Entertainment apps) based on the number of apps available alone. However, we need to check user rating and popularity or downloads before making any suggestions. 
# 
# ## Analyzing App popularity
# 
# Now we move on to checking app popularity by checking the number of installs *or* the user ratings.
# 
# In order to do this, we will perform the following steps to first calculate the average user rating in each genre of app in the iOS store:
# 1. Isolate the apps in each genre
# 2. Calculate the average user rating

# From the above table, it seems like `Navigation` dominates the user ratings followed by `Reference` and `Social Networking`. By examination of the data set, Navigation is primarily dominated by Google maps. Therefore, we would suggest coming up with a free app in either of the two latter categories. 
# 
# The same could be true of any category (needs further analysis).
